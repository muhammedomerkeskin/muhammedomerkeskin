<p align="left">My name is Muhammed Ã–mer Keskin and I'm a Computer Engineer from TÃ¼rkiye</p>

<h2 align="left">I graduated from the Department of Computer Engineering at EskiÅŸehir Technical University and have been intensively working with Java and Python programming languages for 4 years. During my university years, I gained international experience by participating in various projects in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence fields at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany) and Demokritos University of Thrace (Greece).<br><br>After graduation, I started as an intern at a company where I am still working as a Computer Engineer.<br><br>I developed an Android application using Java for the Ground Control Station used in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems. In this project, I practiced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and used Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology to minimize errors. I developed Computer Vision software using Python with Embedded Linux computers in UAV systems. Additionally, I developed desktop and mobile testing software for the company.<br><br>These projects enabled me to adapt to different programming languages.<br><br>Furthermore, throughout my work experience, I gained experience using the following tools and technologies:<br><br>Communication Protocols: UDP, TCP, MAVlink, Serial Port<br><br>Tools: Git, Jira<br><br>IDEs: Android Studio, Pycharm, IntelliJ<br><br>Software: Gazebo, Mission Planner<br><br>Programming Languages: Java, Python<br><br>Operating Systems: Linux, Windows<br><br>During my university years, I conducted training on Soft Skills through education received abroad. I had the opportunity to utilize the experience I gained as the president of IEEE by collaborating with the Human Resources Department of our company to provide English and Turkish seminars to employees.<br><br>For my own development, I am developing mobile and desktop applications for geographic information systems using Java. In this process, I show great enthusiasm and effort in my own time to further develop my software skills. My openness to constantly renewing and learning in the software world increases my interest and dedication to every project. With this enthusiasm, I have started learning Kotlin from scratch. Exploring and learning new technologies in my journey of self-improvement motivates me. This passion and effort play a significant role in achieving both my personal and professional goals</h2>
